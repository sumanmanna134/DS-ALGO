# PROBLEM STATEMENT
## Find Minimum and maximum element in an array
>### Given an array **A** of size **N** of integers. Your task is to find the **minimum** and **maximum** elements in the array.

**Example 1**
```bash
Input:
N = 6
A[] = {3, 2, 1, 56, 10000, 167}
Output:
{"min" = 1, "max" =  10000}
```

**Example 2**
 ```bash
Input:
N = 5
A[]  = {1, 345, 234, 21, 56789}
Output:
{"min" = 1, "max" = 56789}
 ```
>Your Task:  
You don't need to read input or print anything. Your task is to complete the function getMinMax() which takes the array A[] and its size N as inputs and returns the minimum and maximum element of the array.


- Expected Time Complexity: O(n)
- Expected Auxiliary Space: O(1)
- Constraints:
    - 1 <= N <= 10^5
    - 1 <= arr[i] <= 10^12
